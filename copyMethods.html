    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];



    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const newPlayers=players;
    console.log("before change - ",players,newPlayers);
    newPlayers[0]="Raj";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("after change - ",players,newPlayers);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newPlayers2=players.slice();
    console.log("before change - ",players,newPlayers2);
    newPlayers2[0]="Rony";
    console.log("after change - ",players,newPlayers2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const newPlayers3=[...players];
    console.log("before change - ",players,newPlayers3);
    newPlayers3[0]="Rony";
    console.log("after change - ",players,newPlayers3);

    const newPlayers4=Array.from(players);
    console.log("before change - ",players,newPlayers4);
    newPlayers4[0]="Rony";
    console.log("after change - ",players,newPlayers4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2,person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
